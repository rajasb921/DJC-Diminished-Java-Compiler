<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
DJC is a compiler built for Diminished Java (DJ), a programming language developed by Dr. Jay Ligatti at the University of South Florida. DJC converts source programs written in DJ, to target code written in the simplified instruction set architecture DISM. DJC ensures that the program follows DJ sytax, is well-typed and also generates code to perform dynamic runtime checks to limit errors.

### Built With
* C
* FLEX
* BISON

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Since the source files for the compiler are part of the USF course curriculum, they are not directly available in this repo. In order to access all the source files for DJC, request access using Google drive.

Otherwise, download the executable for DJC as well as the sim-dism interpreter.
